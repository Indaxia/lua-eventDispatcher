Solves the [high —Åohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_%28object-oriented_design%29) problem. Based on the observer pattern.

## Installation

```
imp install https://github.com/Indaxia/lua-eventDispatcher

```lua
local EventDispatcher = Imp.import(EventDispatcher)

-- Subscription on the event
-- The event param is an object with "data", "name" and "stopPropagation" properties
-- You can set event.stopPropagation = true inside the callback to break current dispatch loop
EventDispatcher.on("my.event.a", function(event)
    print("Callback A 1: " .. event.data)
end)

-- ... another file ...

-- Dispatch with any data  
EventDispatcher.dispatch("my.event.a", "Dispatch A 1 Data")
